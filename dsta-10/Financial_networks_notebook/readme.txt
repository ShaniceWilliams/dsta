DSTA Financial Networks


1.
Please download the notebooks associated with this lab from the usual class repository.

https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~ale/dsta/

for this lab a companion 'data' folder is required, local to the notebook (or change the paths in the notebook accordingly), please download it from the same place.

2.
Have a go at installing yfinance, a Python package that gets financial data from Yahoo's APIs.
For those running Anaconda the command should be

C:\WINDOWS\system32>conda install -c ranaroussi yfinance

unfortunately, this may generate installation errors on some platforms, e.g., Win 10 LTS at Birkbeck.
Apologies in avance for any technical problems.
This has worked for years...

(to make the notebook more dynamic you may also want to get Yahoofinancials:

https://github.com/JECSand/yahoofinancials

Currently it is not (easily) available from Anaconda)

3.
Networkx: should come with Anaconda's default environment.
Please check this on your installation.
