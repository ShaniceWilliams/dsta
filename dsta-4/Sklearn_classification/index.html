# 1-NN: Nearest-Neighbor class.

Let’s say we have this two-class classification dataset here, with
two features, one on the x axis and one on the y axis.
And we have three new points as marked by the stars here.
If I make a prediction using a one nearest neighbor classifier, what
will it predict?
It will predict the label of the closest data point in the training set.
That is basically the simplest machine learning algorithm I can come
up with.

Here’s the formula:
the prediction for a new x is the y_i so that x_i is the closest point
in the training set.
Ok, so now how do we find out whether this model is any good?

The simplest way is to split the data into a training and a test set.
So we take some part of the data set,  let’s say 75% and the
corresponding output, and train the model, and then apply the model on
the remaining 25% to compute the accuracy. This test-set accuracy
will provide an unbiased estimate of future performance.
So if our i.i.d. assumption is correct, and we get a 90% success
rate on the test data, we expect about a 90% success rate on any future
data, for which we don't have labels.

Let's dive into how to build and evaluate this model with scikit-learn.

## k-NN with Scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# obtain X and y ...
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

K=1
myclassifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=K)

myclassifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("accuracy: {:.2f}".format(myclassifier.score(X_test, y_test)))

y_pred = myclassifier.predict(X_test)
```
accuracy: 0.77

???
We import train_test_split form model selection, which does a
random split into 75%/25%.
We provide it with the data X, which are our two features, and the
labels y.

As you might already know, all the models in scikit-learn are implemented
in python classes, with a single object used to build and store the model.

We start by importing our model, the KneighborsClassifier, and instantiate
it with n_neighbors=1. Instantiating the object is when we set any hyper parameter,
such as here saying that we only want to look at the neirest neighbor.

Then we can call the fit method to build the model, here knn.fit(X_train,
y_train)
All models in scikit-learn have a fit-method, and all the supervised ones take
the data X and the outcomes y. The fit method builds the model and stores any
estimated quantities in the model object, here knn.  In the case of nearest
neighbors, the `fit` methods simply remembers the whole training set.

Then, we can use knn.score to make predictions on the test data, and
compare them against the true labels y_test.

For classification models, the score method will always compute
accuracy.

Just for illustration purposes, I also call the predict method here.
The predict method is what's used to make predictions on any dataset.
If we use the score method, it calls predict internally and then
compares the outcome to the ground truth that's provided.
